# FLYMOV - Flight and Mobility Innovation Center

FLYMOV, a partnership ITA-Embraer-FAPESP, is an Engineering Research Center to transform the Future Air Mobility.

- The development of innovative and disruptive technologies is vital for the future of the aeronautical industry. Embraer and ITA, celebrating their long-standing partnership, and with the support of FAPESP, present FLYMOV, an Engineering Research Center (ERC), to study and develop pre-competitive solutions to transform the air mobility of the future.

- Raising technological readiness through basic and applied research on emerging technologies significantly reduces uncertainties and associated risks to generate innovations in production processes, new products, and new services.

- FLYMOV mobilizes more than 130 people, including researchers, Embraer employees, and scholarship holders - Scientific Initiation, Master, Doctorate, and Post-Doctorate - in an ambitious initiative aiming to establish a new benchmark for the competitiveness of the national industry and for the training of professionals who will transform the air mobility innovation ecosystem.
